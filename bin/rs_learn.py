"""rs_learn.py — the "Learnings" loop: capture what reviewers reject, feed it back.

Every time a reviewer unticks a finding (not worth saying) or edits its wording before posting,
that is a labeled example the dashboard already produces and used to discard. record() logs it;
render() turns recent rejections into a compact block appended to the review prompt so the agent
stops re-raising the same noise; recent() backs the read-only /learnings page.

Storage: $ROOT/learnings.jsonl (ROOT defaults to ~/.claude-pr-bot, same as the server + shell).
Only short gists are stored — high signal, low bloat. Rows carry the repo they came from;
render(repo) prefers same-repo rows and pads with the rest. Imported by server.py;
run-review.sh calls render() via `python3 -c`.
