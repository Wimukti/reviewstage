symbol names, say what is wrong in everyday words\", \"impact\":\"ONE plain sentence: who is

dashboard so they can understand and sign off on each finding WITHOUT reading the whole PR — keep
them jargon-free and self-contained; the body stays the full technical comment.
Set \"confidence\" to how sure you are the finding is real and worth raising — low-confidence
findings are shown to the reviewer in a separate collapsed \"maybe\" tray, so use it honestly
rather than dropping a borderline point. When a finding has a concrete,
correct fix that replaces the SINGLE line you set in \"line\", put the exact replacement line
(matching its indentation) in \"suggestion\" — the reviewer can post it as a one-click GitHub
suggestion. Only when confident and single-line; otherwise leave \"suggestion\" null. A human skims summary/keyPoints/explainer/analysis in a dashboard — write them SHORT and
scannable (point form, plain language), not long prose — then selects, edits and posts individual
comments. Keep findings few and high-confidence.${LEARN}"
